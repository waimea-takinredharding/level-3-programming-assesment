## Project Description

**You are a worker in an automated Universal Production Factory, run by an A.I. called HUD,
designed to keep an eye on factory operations. Unknown causes have spurred HUD to neglect their duties,
throwing the entire factory into disorganised and dangerous disarray. You will need to either:
shut down the production line, convince HUD to continue work, or escape.
